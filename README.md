## Notice
I just wrote this, don't analyze it as it's very nasty.

For now this script will only check for RueDuCommerce.
I'll soon set up a better folder structure for readability's sake.

## Getting Started
1. To run this script you'll require node.
  - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. `git clone` this repo wherever you want.
3. Open a terminal inside the repo folder _(where you just cloned)_.
4. Run `npm i`
5. Run `node *.js`

## Additional info
To terminate job `CTRL+C` for Linux, Windows, and it should probably work the same way for MacOS _(hopefully)_.
